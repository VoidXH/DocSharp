# Doc\#
An easy to use, fast, and minimal C# documentation generator to HTML. Unlike most similar software, this one only requires the source code (no DLL or XML), and doesn't require any accompanying software.

## Licence
The source code, just like the compiled software, is given to you for free, but without any warranty. It is not guaranteed to work, and the developer is not responsible for any damages from the use of the software. You are allowed to make any modifications, and release them for free. If you release a modified version, you have to link this repository as its source. You are not allowed to sell any part of the original or the modified version. You are also not allowed to show advertisements in the modified software. If you include these code or any part of the original version in any other project, these terms still apply.
